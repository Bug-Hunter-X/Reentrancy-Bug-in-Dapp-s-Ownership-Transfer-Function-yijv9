This repository demonstrates a subtle reentrancy vulnerability in a Dapp's ownership transfer function.  The vulnerability allows a malicious actor to potentially hijack ownership. The `_transferOwnership` function is unsafe because it modifies the `owner` state variable before emitting the `OwnershipTransferred` event. A reentrant call can exploit this timing gap by re-entering the `transferOwnership` function before the event is emitted, thus keeping the original owner's control. This improved solution uses the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern for robust protection.
